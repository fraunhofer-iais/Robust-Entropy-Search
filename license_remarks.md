# Remarks on License Use

This is the companion code for the paper "Robust Entropy Search for Safe Efficient Bayesian Optimization" by D. Weichert et al, UAI 2024, licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license, please see the Licenses/license file.
It uses modified code from external sources that falls under various licenses. The use of the code and the associated licenses is described in detail below.

For the Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process (Algorithms/RES/ssgp.py) and Expectation Propagation (Algorithms/RES/ep.py), we use a modified version of the companion code from Noisy-Input Entropy Search for Efficient Robust Bayesian Optimization by Lukas P. Fr√∂hlich et al, AISTATS 2020, found here: https://github.com/boschresearch/NoisyInputEntropySearch. It is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license. Please have a look at the corresponding license files in Licenses/NES_license.

To benchmark our acquisition function, we use a modified version of Max Value Entropy Search (Algorithms/MES/mes.py) from the Emukit project by Paleyes et al., 2019, and Paleyes et al., 2023, found here: https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/tree/main. It is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. Please refer to the corresponding license files in Licenses/emukit_license and Licenses/emukit_notice.
